## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, we explored Airbnb open data from Boston and Seattle and sought to understand the following three business questions:

1. Can you describe the vibe of each Boston/Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston/Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
3. Is there a general upward trend of new Airbnb listings to Boston/Seattle?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- #### Input data files:
The `Boston_data` folder contains Boston Airbnb data consisting of three files: `listings.csv`, `calendar.csv`, and `reviews.csv`. In this project, we only use "listings.csv" and "calendar.csv" as input. Likewise, the "Seattle_data" folder contains Seattle Airbnb data consisting of input files of the same name.

- #### Program files:
`airbnb_boston_seattle_analysis.ipynb` contains all the code for this project, including python programs, results and markdown text.

- #### Result files:
The `images` folder contains all the output figures for this analysis, as well as two publicly downloaded images for the blog.
